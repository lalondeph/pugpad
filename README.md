# Pug Pad

Welcome to **Pug Pad** a simple drawing app I made for my kids. It is written in Java, and designed to be used by a toddler with minimal coaching. To this end the feature set is minimal, the UI is clean and Icon based, and there are no ads, pop-ups or permission needed. All of this has lead to Pug Pad being **Teacher Approved** in the Google Play Store.
